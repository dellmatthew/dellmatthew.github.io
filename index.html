            <h2>What is Emo?</h2>
            <p>Emo is a genre of music that is defined by its angsty themes of heartbreak and emotional pain. The genre has its roots in the post-punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s-1990s, but it has undergone large amounts of changes and developments. Because of this, emo is separated into "waves." These waves have vastly different sounds and are all influenced by the previous artists and their works. The culture of emo appeals to younger individuals feeling those mentioned angsty themes. The stereotypical style in this culture is black clothing, black hair with notably side parts or spikes, with heavy influence from punk culture. The music and people promote ideologies of belonging in places that are alienated from the norms of society.</p>

            <h2>What does it mean to be Global?</h2>
            <p>For something to be global, it first has to start as somewhere local; for emo, this was in Washington, D.C. It then spreads to other major cities, then to the Midwest, and then it leaves the country it originated from and is seen in other countries around the world. For something to hit global status, it has to be accessible; it needs a form of media to present it on a global stage.</p>

            <h2>What does it mean to be Popular?</h2>
            <p>When something is popular, it has both an external and internal meaning. The internal meaning is the artist’s feelings put into the song. It is what they create the song to mean to them and their community. The external meaning is a much more accessible form of the meaning. It can be as simple as “Awesome dance beat” or more powerful like “Don’t trust your government,” both are accessible meanings that the artist incorporates into their work to make it popular.</p>
