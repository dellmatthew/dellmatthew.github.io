            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Matthew DellaTorre, and I was born in the Atlanta Piedmont Hospital on August 10th, 2006. I have lived in Peachtree City my whole life before coming to the University of Georgia. I am adopted along with my 3 siblings to two loving parents. I went to McIntosh High School and graduated with my girlfriend and friends, all coming to UGA as well. I rock climb and listen to a lot of songs. My personal favorite is *Basketball Shoes* by Black Country New Road (specifically the live at Queen Elizabeth Hall).</p>

            <p>At UGA, I am majoring in Computer Science with the goal to (just be hired) be a software engineer for a major tech enterprise. I have always loved computer science and computers in general. I’ve been around them my whole life, with my father who worked in the tech industry for a period of time. The capabilities and engineering that go into them have always fascinated me (plus giving rocks sentience is interesting).</p>

            <h2>Why Global Popular Music?</h2>
            <p>I needed a few more credit hours and, while browsing the list, I landed on this class and thought it sounded interesting. Great to see I was right! Why did I choose Global Popular Emo for my media project? I think that the genre of Emo started in the 1980s and continued to evolve and change, ultimately going mainstream. This is fascinating to me. I really love the sound of the music and, while I don’t adopt key aspects of Emo culture, I enjoy the music very much. Personal favorites include American Football, Sunny Day Real Estate, MCR (of course), Lou Reed, and Fugazi. I think the sound comes from the Punk/Hardcore scene.</p>

            <h2>Who Is This Media Project For?</h2>
            <p>This project is for the internet, where it has the most access to people globally. I wanted my media to be in this form because of its accessibility, which is one of the most important traits in what makes something both “Global” and “Popular.” A website also allows me to organize all the information needed to understand the genre and culture.</p>
